            Hello Friend! My name is Seth Greenbaum, I'm an industrial engineer and student from Denver, CO who's stepping his toes into the world of web development and programming. My area of expertise is food processing, particularly for fruits and vegetables. Strangely, this is the way I got into coding in the first place.

            These days, we live so much of our lives online. What many people don't realize is how the internet has become and integral component of everyday things. Beyond just tv's and phones, the internet influences the way all the material parts of our lives are produced, everything from the way our clothes are made to the way our food is grown. I found myself using coding to solve problems for things like sweet potatoes and carrots. There are endless possibilites for the ways that this technology can improve and transform our lives.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
            I hope you enjoy my profile site, there aren't many projects here yet but I hope to build and innovate as much as possible with these new skills. Peace + Blessings, ~Seth.
